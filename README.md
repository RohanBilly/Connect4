## Description

This was my project for A level Computer Science. It's a Connect 4 game implemented in Python using the Tkinter GUI package. In this game, players can play against a basic AI with three difficulty levels. 

To show off I implemented full colour customisation of the UI, and a text file to store data for a leaderboard.

## What I learned

- Developing a basic AI with different difficulty levels.
- Using Tkinter for building GUI applications.
- Making game menus and a full game loop.
- Working with text files for data storage.
- Using sorting algorithyms.
- Creating customisable GUIs.
- Using python packages.
  
## How to run it
Download the repo and run the Finished Code.py file. Simple as that.
The DataFile.txt is used to store scores for the leaderboard.
